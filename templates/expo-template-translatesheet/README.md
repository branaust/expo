## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    bunx expo start
   ```

## Generating new languages with TranslateSheet

To generate a new language, you must have a valid API key in your `translateSheetConfig.js` file
If you do not have a valid api key, you can get one here: https://app.translatesheet.co/

Once your key is configured, add as many languages as you want to the `languages` array in your `translateSheetConfig.js` file

Lastly, run the command `bun translate-sheet generate`
